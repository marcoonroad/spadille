### About

This is a library to generate random luck numbers in a fair way. Rather than relying
on your process' PRNG blackbox (even if it's a cryptographic secure one), we can generate
noise/randomness that is verifiable through a deterministic/replayable algorithm. Such
kind of algorithms for casinos, raffles & promotions are called [Provably fair algorithms][1].

It becomes even more important when we run in a cluster of processes and we must ensure
that no matter which kind of process receives the request, it must deliver the same noise
output. We prove that property by using HMAC-like PRNG as shown [here][2]. We can keep
the random number generation secret by a moment by just keeping the "HMAC" key secret, and
then open/revealing that for clients during gambling/raffle output/outcome verification.

In a broader context, it can be used for Secure Multi-party Computations too (mostly through
Commitment Schemes). This library provides an API cross-compatible between servers (using Node.js
engine with support to `crypto` OpenSSL's bindings) and browsers (using modern browsers supporting
the `crypto.subtle` API). A good verification flow, thus, would be to generate such noise number
sequences on server-side and then verifying them on client-side.

### Installation

If available on NPM, just type either `npm i spadille` or `yarn add spadille`. Otherwise,
you can pin this project by `npm link .` or `yarn link`, and then linking externally with
either `npm link spadille` or `yarn link spadille`. The release/stable front-end CDN is
available on [UNPKG][3] once the library is available on NPM beforehand. Otherwise, you can just
grab the front-end minified code (at `dist/index.js`).

### Usage

To generate random sequences (paired on Brazillian lotteries if you want to run a raffle without
any kind of audit person):

```javascript
const Lottery = spadille.lottery.brazillian
const megaSenaSequence = await Lottery.megaSena(secret, payload)
const federalNumbers = await Lottery.federal(secret, payload)
```

Here, `secret` is your "HMAC-signing"-key and `payload` is a user/session-derived content (possibly
a session ID, request ID, raffle counter, whatever...). The `megaSenaSequence` is a Mega-Sena lottery
sequence of unique and sorted numbers between 1 and 60, inclusively. Such sequence contains 6 numbers.
The `federalNumbers`, on the other hand, is a string of 5 digits, each one between 0 and 9, and this
sequence may contain repeated numbers (that is, a not unique sequence). Future plans include other famous Brazillian lotteries.

To generate arbitrary random sequences:

```javascript
const arbitrarySequence = await spadille.prng.generate({
  secret,
  payload,
  minimum: minimumInclusiveValue,
  maximum: maximumInclusiveValue,
  amount: outputSequenceLength,
  distinct: booleanFlag,
})
```

Such sequence can be made of many elements as you wish (but keep the eye on hardware limits, e.g,
the limits of 32-bits integer representation). The number of elements are configured by the `amount`
parameter. The `minimum` and `maximum` are point parameters for an inclusive interval (closed on
both sides). The `distinct` is a flag to compute the sequence of unique numbers (without repetitions).

Given that we can generate arbitrary sequences, the random permutation algorithm becomes
straightforward. This kind of permutation would just generate a random index sequence with
minimum as `0`, maximum as `inputSequence.length - 1` and amount as `inputSequence.length`,
where `inputSequence` is the list that we want to permute/shuffle. We then, in the end, use
such random index sequence to map `inputSequence` entries into an output sequence indexed
by such random index sequence. This wrapper function is implemented as an API below:

```javascript
const inputSequence = [ ... ] // an arbitrary list
const outputSequence = await spadille.prng.permute({
  secret, payload, inputSequence
})
/*
 outputSequence is a random permutation of inputSequence
 keep in mind that there are a still unlikely probability
 of random collision where the inputSequence order could
 be preserved for outputSequence, even if this is negligible
*/
```

There's also a helper function provided to help you to generate fresh secrets.
By using cryptograpically secure PRNGs for both Node (through `crypto` OpenSSL
bindings) and browsers (through the `crypto` API), we ensure a good source of
entropy for that noise string. The output string is under binary mode, but you
can nevertheless convert to formats/encodings such as Base-64 and Hexadecimal.
Just pass the amount of bytes to generate and be happy with that! :)

```javascript
const amountOfBytes = 32
const noiseSecret = await spadille.secret.generate(amountOfBytes)
```

Remember that once you generate such secret, you should store it somewhere
to retrieve later to "sign" the random sequences. And in the end, you should
also publish such secret in a commitment/opening style for public verification
by your users/clients.
